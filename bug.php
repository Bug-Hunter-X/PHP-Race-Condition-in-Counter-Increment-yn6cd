This code suffers from a potential race condition. If multiple requests to the `updateCounter` function happen concurrently, the counter value may not be updated accurately due to the lack of proper locking mechanism or atomic operations.  Each request reads the current counter value, increments it, and then writes it back. If two requests do this simultaneously, they might both read the same old value, increment it, and then write it back, resulting in only one increment instead of two. 

```php
<?php

$counter = 0;

function updateCounter() {
    global $counter;
    $counter++;
}

// Simulate multiple concurrent requests
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    updateCounter();
}

echo "Counter value: " . $counter; // Might not be 10

?>
```
